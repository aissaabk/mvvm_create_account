1. Gradle Dependencies:
Ensure you have the Firebase Authentication library added to your app's build.gradle file:

gradle
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:22.0.0'
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel:2.4.0'

Don't forget to add the necessary permissions and declare your activities in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

<application>
    <!-- ... other configurations ... -->
    <activity android:name=".CreateAccountActivity" />
</application>
      
This example demonstrates a basic MVVM structure for creating a user account using Firebase in a Java Android application. 
Note that in a real-world application, you might want to include additional features like input validation, 
loading indicators, and error handling to enhance the user experience
